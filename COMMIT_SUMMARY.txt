feat: partner platform MVP with IDfy KYC & admin console

MAJOR RELEASE: Complete partner platform with real-time features (100% MVP)

## What's New

### Database & Integration
- Added 004_partner_platform_schema.sql (7 tables with RLS, FTS, triggers)
- Built IDfy KYC integration (PAN/GST/Bank verification - ₹10-15 per call)
- Extended supabase-data.ts with 15+ partner functions (DRY - no duplication)

### Partner Onboarding (IDFC-Style)
- 4-step progressive flow: Business → KYC → Banking → Catalog
- Real-time IDfy verification with instant feedback (green/red states)
- Auto-save progress, resume from last step
- Pending approval page (24h review timeline)

### Partner Dashboard (Swiggy-Style)
- Mobile-first layout with bottom nav (Home, Catalog, Orders, Earnings, Profile)
- Dashboard Home with stats cards (Orders, Earnings, Rating, Acceptance)
- **Catalog Manager**: Full product CRUD with image upload to Supabase Storage
- **Orders**: Real-time tracking with proof upload (gifting-specific)
- **Earnings**: Payout history with commission breakdown
- **Profile**: Business settings with KYC verification status
- Responsive 2-col mobile, 4-col desktop grid
- Reuses customer UI design system (same colors, components, spacing)

### Admin Console
- **Overview**: Platform stats (Partners, Products, Orders, Revenue)
- **Partner Approvals**: Review queue with IDfy verification status
- Approve/Reject workflow with mandatory reason
- Admin action logging for audit trail

### DRY Implementation
- Zero duplication: Same #CD1C18 primary, Shadcn components, Tailwind classes
- Extended existing files vs. creating new (supabase-data.ts, not partner-data.ts)
- Consistent mobile-first patterns (bottom nav, sticky header, max-w containers)
